# AI models and settings

## Where the settings are

Open **Settings** from the row at the bottom left of Home and choose **AI**. What you see first is the subscription connection. That is all most people need, and it has its own article: [Subscription connection](help://subscription).

Everything that takes a key is under **Advanced**, at the bottom of the same page. It stays closed until you open it.

## The default: your subscription

- **AI to use** starts on **Automatic**: a connected Claude subscription first, then Codex.
- Automatic never picks anything that costs extra money. An API key is used only while you choose that provider yourself under **AI to use**.
- The model list at the bottom of each AI panel shows the subscriptions first, then the key providers you have finished setting up. Under a subscription, **Default model** is the standard model for that subscription.

## API keys (Advanced ▸ AI Model)

For people who would rather pay a provider directly, or run a model of their own.

- Choose a **Provider**, enter its **API Key** (and a **Base URL** where the provider needs one), pick a **Model**, then press **Save**. The list covers OpenAI-compatible servers, Anthropic, Gemini, DeepSeek, DashScope (qwen), Atlas Cloud and more.
- The **Provider** list here only decides whose fields are on screen. It does not change which AI is in use; that is always **AI to use**.
- Chats on a key provider use your own key, and that provider charges you for them.
- Keys are stored in the app's settings file on this machine and sent only in request headers.
- **Test connection**: verify endpoint reachability and model visibility before saving.
- Base URLs may carry a path and query string (gateway-style); endpoint paths are appended correctly.
- For servers you run yourself, several **endpoints** can be saved and switched between at any time.
- **Codex executable** is only for a Codex program installed in an unusual place. Leave it empty and the program is found automatically.

## Which feature needs what

| Feature                                             | What it runs on                                                                                                                                                                               |
| --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Chat and editing in the AI panel                    | Your subscription, or a key provider you chose yourself.                                                                                                                                      |
| Understanding a picture                             | The AI you are chatting with looks at the picture itself. No extra key is needed. A separate analysis provider can be chosen under Advanced.                                                  |
| Generating a picture                                | **A key only, in this version.** Set up an image provider under Advanced ▸ AI Media & Search. Without one, image generation is unavailable, and Slides uses pictures found by search instead. |
| Video and audio analysis                            | A key provider that supports video, chosen under Advanced ▸ AI Media & Search.                                                                                                                |
| Web and image search, reading a page by its address | Free by default, with no key. A search provider key is optional.                                                                                                                              |
| Search inside your own files                        | Runs on this machine. Reranking the results through a service is optional and off by default.                                                                                                 |

Under **Advanced ▸ AI Media & Search**, a provider's key and base URL are entered once and shared by every feature that uses that provider.

## When changes apply

- Model and endpoint changes apply immediately; an in-flight conversation keeps the old configuration until its next turn.

## Ollama servers and models

On the first visit, **Local Ollama** appears by default and fetches its models. If you remove it, it will not be recreated.

In **Settings → Ollama → Add server**, enter a name and address. The default is `http://localhost:11434/v1`; the API key is optional. Adding a server fetches its installed models. **Register** adds a model to **AI → AI to use** and document model pickers without changing the current AI.

Click a server name to edit its name, address or key; saving also updates its registered models. **Test connection** refreshes the model list. Removing a server removes its registered entries, but keeps model files on the server. Once a local server and models are ready, they can work offline. Document editing requires tool-call support.
